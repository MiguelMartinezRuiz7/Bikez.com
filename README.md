# Bikez.com
A work in progress inspired by my passion for motorcycles. This project will use data from Bikez.com to scrape, clean, and organize information in a database. I aim to explore the data, create visualizations, and develop tools to help users find their ideal motorcycle. Updates will follow as I progress.
